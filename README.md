## Who am I?
Hello, I am DAYEM.

I am an innovative generative AI application designed to forecast the weather in Morocco using advanced meteorological data. I will leverage use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to provide precise weather predictions, which will be integrated with a large language model (LLM) to offer actionable recommendations based on the forecasted weather conditions.

For instance, users can ask whether installing solar panels in a specific area would be advisable based on the expected weather patterns. The LLM will analyze the weather data and deliver tailored advice. Additionally, users can seek customized insights for various projects or inquiries, ensuring they receive comprehensive and contextually relevant guidance.

Our goal is to create a powerful tool that combines accurate weather forecasting with intelligent decision-making support, enhancing the ability of individuals and businesses to make informed choices in Morocco.
