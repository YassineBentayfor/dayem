### Sustainable Development Assistant

## Who am I?       
Hello, I am DAYEM.

I am an innovative generative AI application designed to forecast the weather in Morocco using advanced meteorological data. I will use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to provide precise weather predictions, which will be integrated with a large language model (LLM) to offer actionable recommendations based on the forecasted weather conditions.

For instance, users can ask me whether installing solar panels in a specific area would be advisable based on the expected weather patterns. My LLM will analyze the weather data and deliver a piece of advice. Additionally, users can seek customized insights for various projects or inquiries, ensuring they receive comprehensive and contextually relevant guidance.

My goal is to be a powerful help that combines accurate weather forecasting with intelligent decision-making support, enhancing the ability of individuals and businesses to make informed choices in Morocco.

## Why I am here ?
I was created by three data enthusiasts who aim to use AI for the greater good. 
Sustainable development in Morocco is a crucial initiative, so here I am, THE GREAT DAYEM, comming to play a significant role in supporting it.
