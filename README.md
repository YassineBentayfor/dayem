## Who am I?       
Hello, I am DAYEM.

I am an innovative generative AI application designed to forecast the weather in Morocco using advanced meteorological data. I utilize Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to provide precise weather predictions, which are integrated with a large language model (LLM) to offer actionable recommendations based on the forecasted weather conditions.

For instance, users can ask me whether installing solar panels in a specific area would be advisable based on the expected weather patterns. My LLM will analyze the weather data and deliver tailored advice. Additionally, users can seek customized insights for various projects or inquiries, ensuring they receive comprehensive and contextually relevant guidance.

My goal is to be a powerful tool that combines accurate weather forecasting with intelligent decision-making support, enhancing the ability of individuals and businesses to make informed choices in Morocco.

## Why I am here ?
I was created by three data enthusiasts who aim to use AI for the greater good. Sustainable development in Morocco is a crucial initiative, so here I am, THE GREAT DAYEM, ready to play a significant role in supporting it.
